## Description
This project was created in order to override calls to `gethostname(2)` and `sethostname(2)` in libc.  This is mainly useful inside docker containers for situations where you cannot control the conditions in which the container was originally started in a similarly useful way, such as under Kubernetes.


Some applications, especially erlang applications, impose requirements related to the erlang distribution protocol that make running them under containers, especially Kubernetes, a painful experience.  This is the usecase `overridehostname` was designed for.  Although this can also be achieved by running the container with the `SYS_ADMIN` capability, I felt that is a rather unacceptable compromise just to change a container hostname.


## Installation
* Place liboverridehostname.so.1 somewhere easy to remember.  I use `/usr/local/lib/` personally.
* Add the entire path to the library to LD_PRELOAD and export. Example: `export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/liboverridehostname.so.1` *this alone does not activate the library.*


## Activation
* Export `OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME=true` to your environment.  Example: `export OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME=true`.


## Changing the hostname
```bash
hostname <new-hostname>
```


## Don't forget
* To add the hostname and FQDN to /etc/hosts
```bash
echo "<ip.add.re.ss>    <new-hostname-fqdn> <new-hostname>" >> /etc/hosts
```

* To remove the old hostname if you aren't using it anymore
```bash
sed -i "/$OLD_HOSTNAME/d" /etc/hosts
```

**Under docker this is harder, but the following hack will work**
```bash
echo "$(sed "/$OLD_HOSTNAME/d" /etc/hosts)" > /etc/hosts
```
